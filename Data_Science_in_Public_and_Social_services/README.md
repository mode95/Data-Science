# Walletize

An easier way to share payment methods with everybody, a website (GUI created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript) that facilitate the exchange of payments information (in particular IBAN's) between users. The development of Walletize is based on the use of a NoSQL database (MongoDB) to employ its potential. Also, RESTful APIs have been implemented (with Flask) to allow third-party applications to use Walletize services.
